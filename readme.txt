Description:
This is a simple game in which a user is playing against a computer.
There are four choices: rock, paper, scissors, or q. rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, paper
beats rock, q stops the game.
the game does not have an interface so the user needs no use Python console.

The game is available in two modes, in the first, a player will choose the number of times a game will be played
and the winner will be determined on who wins most games. In the second mode the winner is determined in a single game,
The program runs until the player quits, the basic stats are printed to the console afterwards.
    (I did it as a challenge to simply practice solving small problems that may arise.)
